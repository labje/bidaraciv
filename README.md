Spanish judgments on custody

This repository contains the dataset and model generated in the research project "Analysis through Big Data of the legal argumentation contained in civil jurisdiction rulings in Aragon". 
They consist of a set of 3000 appellate judgments resolving issues on child custody (individual or joint), alimony and allocation of the family home. Each of the judgments was manually labelled by two jurists, using the Brat program (https://brat.nlplab.org/). Only the legal grounds of the judgments were labelled.

The contents of the repository are as follows:
-	Description of the labels
-	Text of the judgments (grounds of law)
-	Tags

The name of the judgments is as follow:
-	AP: provincial audience
-	XX: province
-	XXXX: year
-	XXXXX: number

In addition, the data used in a predictive model, elaborated with data extracted from the manual labelling of the sentences, is included. This model is described in Mu√±oz Soro JF, Serrano-Cinca C (2021) A model for predicting court decisions on child custody. PLoS ONE 16(10): e0258993. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258993.
